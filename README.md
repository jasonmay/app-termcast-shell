termcast-shell
====================================================

This app a shell command, which is just a thin wrapper around a Perl
module (App::Termcast::Shell).

### Uses

One of the reasons this app is being developed is for easy testing of
the termcast server without the overhead of infrastructures like Telnet
and HTTP.

Another use is the allowance of people to connect and view streams securely
via SSH. With a system of authorized SSH keys, a local, private, and (most
importantly) secure Termcast setup can be established.
